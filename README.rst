Cookiecutter_ template for generating a "reasonably standardized" skeleton for a Python-based data science project.

Summary
-------

This Cookiecutter_ template allows for the creation of a "reasonably standardized", but flexible project structure [#]_ when starting a new Python-based data science project. The purpose of using such a structure and implementing it with Cookiecutter is to:

* Take the guesswork and low-value manual labor out of the process of standing up a new data science project
* Get started far more quickly on the more important analysis and data science work when stating a new project
* Create consistency across projects, making it easier to interpret and replicate your data science projects

This project takes inspiration and borrows heavily from several other fabulous Cookiecutter templates available on GitHub:

* `drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science`_
* `ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary`_

To draft this project, I have started by taking the characteristics I find most important from the above listed templates.

This project, in its current form, is in no way complete. This template is currently being actively developed and will evolve as

.. [#]  The "reasonably standardized", but flexible project structure comprising this Cookiecutter template was heavily inspired by the `drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science`_ template. For a full overview of that template please see the `cookiecutter-data-science project page`_.

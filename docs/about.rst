About this project
==================

This page contains useful information to help you learn a bit more about the ``cc-pydata`` project and how it is configured.

* If your goal is to learn more about the Cookiecutter tool used as the basis for the ``cc-pydata`` project, your best source of information will be the official Cookiecutter_ documentation.

* If you just want to know what the ``cc-pydata`` project is, please see the :ref:`README<README>` documentation for the project.

* If you want to (a) learn more about the how to generate or use the resulting ``cc-pydata`` template or (b) better understand the features and functionality embedded in the resulting ``cc-pydata`` template, please see the :ref:`Tutorial` for this project.

Development philosophy
----------------------

As is discussed in the :ref:`design` section of the ``cc-pydata`` documentation, I have sought to balance Python best practices and standards with my own needs across a wide range of projects. What's more, I've also sought to embed structural characteristics of other great Cookiecutter templates (see :ref:`sources`).

Starting from those initial principals, I hope to have built a Cookiecutter template that is flexible and robust enough for others to find useful for their own Python data science projects.

I have taken the time to :ref:`carefully test<project-testing>` and document the ``cc-pydata`` project, both for my own sake, as well as for the sake of others who might find this project and wish to use it themselves.

I hope that the :ref:`Tutorial` for this project not only enlightens the user, but provides (a) the blueprint needed for those who may not be familiar with all of the tools and methods employed in the template, and (b) enough of a foundation for those who wish `to fork <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)>`_ and modify the project to better suit their own needs.

Contributing
------------

As is mentioned above in the development philosophy for this project, I have sought to balance best practices and features with my own particular needs. Therefore, I am not actively seeking contributions to the ``cc-pydata`` project from others. My primary reason being that, as soon as others begin adding features to this project, the more likely it will be that the template no longer fits my specific needs.

If however, you do see opportunities to improve this project and its resulting template, I would still be interested in hearing from you.

I am not quite sure how firm I am on my position of "no contributions." Therefore, if you have great ideas on how to improve this project, there's a very good chance that I can be convinced!
